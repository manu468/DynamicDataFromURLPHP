# DynamicDataFromURLPHP

Simple PHP program for dynamically parsing data from the user to collecting it at backend using $_GET methods.

A single function checker is also added in this program with which we can see the functionality of the particular function instead of
checking the output of  the whole file 

sample url for the local web servers such as Xamp/ Mamp will be : localhost/filename.php?f=function-name&varname=value&varName2=value
